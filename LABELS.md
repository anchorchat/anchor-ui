We group labels by color. This will help to clarify what kind of issue it is. We have determined the following groups and labels.

<h3>

<h3>

<h3>
  <img height="1.25em" src="./labels/experience.svg" alt="Experience">
</h3>
Affect user’s comprehension, or overall enjoyment of the product. These can be both opportunities and “UX bugs”.

<h3>
  <img height="1.25em" src="./labels/environment.svg" alt="Environment">
</h3>

<h3>
  <img height="1.25em" src="./labels/feedback.svg" alt="Feedback">

<h3>
  <img height="1.25em" src="./labels/improvements.svg" alt="Improvements">
</h3>
Iterations on existing features or infrastructure. Generally these update speed, or improve the quality of results. Adding a new “Prop” field to an existing Component in the API, for example.

</h3>
Brand new functionality. New Component, workflows, etc.

<h3>
  <img height="1.25em" src="./labels/pending.svg" alt="Pending">
</h3>
Taking action, but need a few things to happen first. A feature that needs dependencies merged, or a bug that needs further data.

<h3>
  <img height="1.25em" src="./labels/inactive.svg" alt="Inactive">
</h3>
No action needed or possible. The issue is either fixed, addressed better by other issues, or just out of product scope.

<h3>
  <img height="1.25em" src="./labels/help-wanted.svg" alt="Help Wanted">
