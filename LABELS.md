# Label Groups

We group labels by color. This will help to clarify what kind of issue it is. We have determined the following groups and labels.

## Groups

### <td bgcolor="#eb414b">Problems</td>
Issues that make the product feel broken. High priority, especially if its present in production.

### <td bgcolor="#FDF1C2">Mindless</td>
Converting measurements, reorganizing folder structure, writing documentation, and other necessary (but less impactful) tasks.

### <td bgcolor="#FEC17A">Experience</td>
Affect user’s comprehension, or overall enjoyment of the product. These can be both opportunities and “UX bugs”.

### <td bgcolor="#F9D8C8">Environment</td>
Server environment. In which environment did you find the bug. With good QA, you’ll identify issues on test and staging deployments.

### <td bgcolor="#CA357C">Feedback</td>
Requires further conversation to figure out the action steps. Most feature ideas start here.

### <td bgcolor="#63BFFC">Improvements</td>
Iterations on existing features or infrastructure. Generally these update speed, or improve the quality of results. Adding a new “Prop” field to an existing Component in the API, for example.

### <td bgcolor="#92C85C">Additions</td>
Brand new functionality. New Component, workflows, etc.

### <td bgcolor="#FAC92F">Pending</td>
Taking action, but need a few things to happen first. A feature that needs dependencies merged, or a bug that needs further data.

### <td bgcolor="#D2DAE1">Inactive</td>
No action needed or possible. The issue is either fixed, addressed better by other issues, or just out of product scope.

### <td bgcolor="#C0D4F1">Help Wanted</td>
Action taken but got stuck on something. Another contributor will be able to see that help is wanted.

### <td bgcolor="#F15E49">Release</td>
Which type of release are we talking about for this issue. Patch, minor or major according to [semver](http://semver.org/)
