# Label Groups

We group labels by color. This will help to clarify what kind of issue it is. We have determined the following groups and labels.

## Groups

### Problems
Issues that make the product feel broken. High priority, especially if its present in production.

### Mindless
Converting measurements, reorganizing folder structure, writing documentation, and other necessary (but less impactful) tasks.

### Experience
Affect user’s comprehension, or overall enjoyment of the product. These can be both opportunities and “UX bugs”.

### Environment
Server environment. In which environment did you find the bug. With good QA, you’ll identify issues on test and staging deployments.

### Feedback
Requires further conversation to figure out the action steps. Most feature ideas start here.

### Improvements
Iterations on existing features or infrastructure. Generally these update speed, or improve the quality of results. Adding a new “Prop” field to an existing Component in the API, for example.

### Additions
Brand new functionality. New Component, workflows, etc.

### Pending
Taking action, but need a few things to happen first. A feature that needs dependencies merged, or a bug that needs further data.

### Inactive
No action needed or possible. The issue is either fixed, addressed better by other issues, or just out of product scope.

### Help Wanted
Action taken but got stuck on something. Another contributor will be able to see that help is wanted.
