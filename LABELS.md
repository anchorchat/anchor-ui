# Label Groups

We group labels by color. This will help to clarify what kind of issue it is. We have determined the following groups and labels.

## Groups

### ![Problems](./labels/problems.svg)
Issues that make the product feel broken. High priority, especially if its present in production.

### ![Mindless](./labels/mindless.svg)
Converting measurements, reorganizing folder structure, writing documentation, and other necessary (but less impactful) tasks.

### ![Experience](./labels/experience.svg)
Affect user’s comprehension, or overall enjoyment of the product. These can be both opportunities and “UX bugs”.

### ![Environment](./labels/environment.svg)
Server environment. In which environment did you find the bug. With good QA, you’ll identify issues on test and staging deployments.

### ![Feedback](./labels/feedback.svg)
Requires further conversation to figure out the action steps. Most feature ideas start here.

### ![Improvements](./labels/improvements.svg)
Iterations on existing features or infrastructure. Generally these update speed, or improve the quality of results. Adding a new “Prop” field to an existing Component in the API, for example.

### ![Additions](./labels/additions.svg)
Brand new functionality. New Component, workflows, etc.

### ![Pending](./labels/pending.svg)
Taking action, but need a few things to happen first. A feature that needs dependencies merged, or a bug that needs further data.

### ![Inactive](./labels/inactive.svg)
No action needed or possible. The issue is either fixed, addressed better by other issues, or just out of product scope.

### ![Help Wanted](./labels/help-wanted.svg)
Action taken but got stuck on something. Another contributor will be able to see that help is wanted.

### ![Release](./labels/release.svg)
Which type of release are we talking about for this issue. Patch, minor or major according to [semver](http://semver.org/)
