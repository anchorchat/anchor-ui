# Label Groups

We group labels by color. This will help to clarify what kind of issue it is. We have determined the following groups and labels.

## Groups

<h3><span style="background: #eb414b; padding: 5px; border-radius: 3px;">Problems</span></h3>
Issues that make the product feel broken. High priority, especially if its present in production.

<h3><span style="background: #FDF1C2; color: #424242; padding: 5px; border-radius: 3px;">Mindless</span></h3>
Converting measurements, reorganizing folder structure, writing documentation, and other necessary (but less impactful) tasks.

<h3><span style="background: #FEC17A; color: #424242; padding: 5px; border-radius: 3px;">Experience</span></h3>
Affect user’s comprehension, or overall enjoyment of the product. These can be both opportunities and “UX bugs”.

<h3><span style="background: #F9D8C8; color: #424242; padding: 5px; border-radius: 3px;">Environment</span></h3>
Server environment. In which environment did you find the bug. With good QA, you’ll identify issues on test and staging deployments.

<h3><span style="background: #CA357C; padding: 5px; border-radius: 3px;">Feedback</span></h3>
Requires further conversation to figure out the action steps. Most feature ideas start here.

<h3><span style="background: #63BFFC; color: #424242; padding: 5px; border-radius: 3px;">Improvements</span></h3>
Iterations on existing features or infrastructure. Generally these update speed, or improve the quality of results. Adding a new “Prop” field to an existing Component in the API, for example.

<h3><span style="background: #92C85C; color: #424242; padding: 5px; border-radius: 3px;">Additions</span></h3>
Brand new functionality. New Component, workflows, etc.

<h3><span style="background: #FAC92F; color: #424242; padding: 5px; border-radius: 3px;">Pending</span></h3>
Taking action, but need a few things to happen first. A feature that needs dependencies merged, or a bug that needs further data.

<h3><span style="background: #D2DAE1; color: #424242; padding: 5px; border-radius: 3px;">Inactive</span></h3>
No action needed or possible. The issue is either fixed, addressed better by other issues, or just out of product scope.

<h3><span style="background: #C0D4F1; color: #424242; padding: 5px; border-radius: 3px;">Help Wanted</span></h3>
Action taken but got stuck on something. Another contributor will be able to see that help is wanted.

<h3><span style="background: #F15E49; padding: 5px; border-radius: 3px;">Release</span></h3>
Which type of release are we talking about for this issue. Patch, minor or major according to [semver](http://semver.org/)
