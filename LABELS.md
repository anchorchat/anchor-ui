# Labels

## Groups

We group labels by color. This will help to clarify what kind of issue it is. We have determined the following groups and labels.

<h3>
  <img height="35px" src="labels/problems.png" alt="Problems">
</h3>

Issues that make the product feel broken. High priority, especially if its present in production.

<h3>
  <img height="35px" src="labels/mindless.png" alt="Mindless">
</h3>

Converting measurements, reorganizing folder structure, writing documentation, and other necessary (but less impactful) tasks.

<h3>
  <img height="35px" src="labels/experience.png" alt="Experience">
</h3>

Affect user’s comprehension, or overall enjoyment of the product. These can be both opportunities and “UX bugs”.

<h3>
  <img height="35px" src="labels/environment.png" alt="Environment">
</h3>

Server environment. In which environment did you find the bug. With good QA, you’ll identify issues on test and staging deployments.

<h3>
  <img height="35px" src="labels/feedback.png" alt="Feedback">
</h3>

Requires further conversation to figure out the action steps. Most feature ideas start here.

<h3>
  <img height="35px" src="labels/improvements.png" alt="Improvements">
</h3>

Iterations on existing features or infrastructure. Generally these update speed, or improve the quality of results. Adding a new “Prop” field to an existing Component in the API, for example.

<h3>
  <img height="35px" src="labels/additions.png" alt="Additions">
</h3>

Brand new functionality. New Component, workflows, etc.

<h3>
  <img height="35px" src="labels/pending.png" alt="Pending">
</h3>

Taking action, but need a few things to happen first. A feature that needs dependencies merged, or a bug that needs further data.

<h3>
  <img height="35px" src="labels/inactive.png" alt="Inactive">
</h3>

No action needed or possible. The issue is either fixed, addressed better by other issues, or just out of product scope.

<h3>
  <img height="35px" src="labels/help-wanted.png" alt="Help Wanted">
</h3>

Action taken but got stuck on something. Another contributor will be able to see that help is wanted.

<h3>
  <img height="35px" src="labels/release.png" alt="Release">
</h3>

Kind of type this PR should be released in. Patch, minor or major according to [semver](http://semver.org/). *Labels meant for PR's*
